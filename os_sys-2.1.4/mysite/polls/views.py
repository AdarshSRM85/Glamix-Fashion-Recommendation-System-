<p>first there are somethings you need to know:<br>
1. this docs are under devlopment.<br>
2. if you want to add somethings to this docs go to os_sys github and post a what you want to add and i will ad it.<br>
3. have fun with this package.</p>

<div id="getting started">
<p>
thanks for downloading os_sys. i hope you will enjoy using it this. this is a doc to help you getting started with os_sys.
os_sys is my first big package. again i hope you will enjoy using it so. lets get started.<br>
typ:<br>
import os_sys<br>
print(os_sys.msg)
if the installation was a succes you wil se in the shell:<br>
installation succes<br>
else you will get a error. so now you have installed os_sys you are ready to use it

<h1>loading_bars:
Easy progress reporting for Python</h1>
<p>|pypi|</p>
<h2>Bars</h2>
<p>There are 7 progress bars to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Bar</code></li>
<li><code>ChargingBar</code></li>
<li><code>FillingSquaresBar</code></li>
<li><code>FillingCirclesBar</code></li>
<li><code>IncrementalBar</code></li>
<li><code>PixelBar</code></li>
<li><code>ShadyBar</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To use them, just call <code>next</code> to advance and <code>finish</code> to finish:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>from os_sys.progress import bar

bar = Bar('Processing', max=20)
for i in range(20):
    # Do some work
    bar.next()
bar.finish()
</code></pre>
<p>or use any bar of this class as a context manager:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>from os_sys.progress import bar

with Bar('Processing', max=20) as bar:
    for i in range(20):
        # Do some work
        bar.next()
</code></pre>
<p>The result will be a bar like the following: ::</p>
<pre><code>Processing |#############                   | 42/100
</code></pre>
<p>To simplify the common case where the work is done in an iterator, you can
use the <code>iter</code> method:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>for i in Bar('Processing').iter(it):
    # Do some work
</code></pre>
<p>Progress bars are very customizable, you can change their width, their fill
character, their suffix and more:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>bar = Bar('Loading', fill='@', suffix='%(percent)d%%')
</code></pre>
<p>This will produce a bar like the following: ::</p>
<pre><code>Loading |@@@@@@@@@@@@@                   | 42%
</code></pre>
<p>You can use a number of template arguments in <code>message</code> and <code>suffix</code>:</p>
<p>==========  ================================
Name        Value
==========  ================================
index       current value
max         maximum value
remaining   max - index
progress    index / max
percent     progress * 100
avg         simple moving average time per item (in seconds)
elapsed     elapsed time in seconds
elapsed_td  elapsed as a timedelta (useful for printing as a string)
eta         avg * remaining
eta_td      eta as a timedelta (useful for printing as a string)
==========  ================================</p>
<p>Instead of passing all configuration options on instatiation, you can create
your custom subclass:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>class FancyBar(Bar):
    message = 'Loading'
    fill = '*'
    suffix = '%(percent).1f%% - %(eta)ds'
</code></pre>
<p>You can also override any of the arguments or create your own:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>class SlowBar(Bar):
    suffix = '%(remaining_hours)d hours remaining'
    @property
    def remaining_hours(self):
        return self.eta // 3600
</code></pre>
<h1>Spinners</h1>
<p>For actions with an unknown number of steps you can use a spinner:</p>
<p>.. code-block:: python</p>
<pre><code>from os_sys.progress import spinner

spinner = Spinner('Loading ')
while state != 'FINISHED':
    # Do some work
    spinner.next()
</code></pre>
<p>There are 5 predefined spinners:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Spinner</code></li>
<li><code>PieSpinner</code></li>
<li><code>MoonSpinner</code></li>
<li><code>LineSpinner</code></li>
<li><code>PixelSpinner</code></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    os_sys python lib to use.

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    os_sys  Copyright (C) 2018  os_sys-devlopment-group
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

<br>
<br>__spec__ = class ModuleSpec(builtins.object)
<br> |  __spec__(name, loader, *, origin=None, loader_state=None, is_package=None)
<br> |
<br> |  The specification for a module, used for loading.
<br> |
<br> |  A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
<br> |  data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
<br> |  loader.
<br> |
<br> |  `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
<br> |  to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
<br> |  package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.
<br> |
<br> |  `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
<br> |  not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.
<br> |
<br> |  `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
<br> |  load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
<br> |  set, origin will match.
<br> |
<br> |  `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
<br> |  When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.
<br> |
<br> |  `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
<br> |  corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.
<br> |
<br> |  `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
<br> |  search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
<br> |  True--and False otherwise.
<br> |
<br> |  Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
<br> |  has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
<br> |  system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.
<br> |
<br> |  Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
<br> |  importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.

<br>Help on module os:
<br>
<br>NAME
<br>    os - OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.
<br>
<br>DESCRIPTION
<br>    This exports:
<br>      - all functions from posix or nt, e.g. unlink, stat, etc.
<br>      - os.path is either posixpath or ntpath
<br>      - os.name is either 'posix' or 'nt'
<br>      - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory (always '.')
<br>      - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory (always '..')
<br>      - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or '\\')
<br>      - os.extsep is the extension separator (always '.')
<br>      - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')
<br>      - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc
<br>      - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')
<br>      - os.defpath is the default search path for executables
<br>      - os.devnull is the file path of the null device ('/dev/null', etc.)
<br>
<br>    Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being
<br>    portable between different platforms.  Of course, they must then
<br>    only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink
<br>    and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path
<br>    (e.g., split and join).

<br>
<br>FUNCTIONS
<br>    _exit(status)
<br>        Exit to the system with specified status, without normal exit processing.
<br>
<br>    abort()
<br>        Abort the interpreter immediately.
<br>
<br>        This function 'dumps core' or otherwise fails in the hardest way possible
<br>        on the hosting operating system.  This function never returns.
<br>
<br>    access(path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, effective_ids=False, follow_symlinks=True)
<br>        Use the real uid/gid to test for access to a path.
<br>
<br>          path
<br>            Path to be tested; can be string or bytes
<br>          mode
<br>            Operating-system mode bitfield.  Can be F_OK to test existence,
<br>            or the inclusive-OR of R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK.
<br>          dir_fd
<br>            If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>            and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that
<br>            directory.
<br>          effective_ids
<br>            If True, access will use the effective uid/gid instead of
<br>            the real uid/gid.
<br>          follow_symlinks
<br>            If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
<br>            access will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
<br>            the link points to.
<br>
<br>        dir_fd, effective_ids, and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
<br>          on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
<br>          NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>        Note that most operations will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this
<br>          routine can be used in a suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user
<br>          has the specified access to the path.
<br>
<br>    chdir(path)
<br>        Change the current working directory to the specified path.
<br>
<br>        path may always be specified as a string.
<br>        On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
<br>          If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
<br>
<br>    chmod(path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
<br>        Change the access permissions of a file.
<br>
<br>          path
<br>            Path to be modified.  May always be specified as a str or bytes.
<br>            On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
<br>            If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
<br>          mode
<br>            Operating-system mode bitfield.
<br>          dir_fd
<br>            If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>            and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that
<br>            directory.
<br>          follow_symlinks
<br>            If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
<br>            chmod will modify the symbolic link itself instead of the file
<br>            the link points to.
<br>
<br>        It is an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
<br>          an open file descriptor.
<br>        dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    close(fd)
<br>        Close a file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    closerange(fd_low, fd_high, /)
<br>        Closes all file descriptors in [fd_low, fd_high), ignoring errors.
<br>
<br>    cpu_count()
<br>        Return the number of CPUs in the system; return None if indeterminable.
<br>
<br>        This number is not equivalent to the number of CPUs the current process can
<br>        use.  The number of usable CPUs can be obtained with
<br>        ``len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))``
<br>
<br>    device_encoding(fd)
<br>        Return a string describing the encoding of a terminal's file descriptor.
<br>
<br>        The file descriptor must be attached to a terminal.
<br>        If the device is not a terminal, return None.
<br>
<br>    dup(fd, /)
<br>        Return a duplicate of a file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    dup2(fd, fd2, inheritable=True)
<br>        Duplicate file descriptor.

<br>        Encode filename (an os.PathLike, bytes, or str) to the filesystem
<br>        encoding with 'surrogateescape' error handler, return bytes unchanged.
<br>        On Windows, use 'strict' error handler if the file system encoding is
<br>        'mbcs' (which is the default encoding).
<br>
<br>    fspath(path)
<br>        Return the file system path representation of the object.
<br>
<br>        If the object is str or bytes, then allow it to pass through as-is. If the
<br>        object defines __fspath__(), then return the result of that method. All other
<br>        types raise a TypeError.
<br>
<br>    fstat(fd)
<br>        Perform a stat system call on the given file descriptor.
<br>
<br>        Like stat(), but for an open file descriptor.
<br>        Equivalent to os.stat(fd).
<br>
<br>    fsync(fd)
<br>        Force write of fd to disk.
<br>
<br>    ftruncate(fd, length, /)
<br>        Truncate a file, specified by file descriptor, to a specific length.
<br>
<br>    get_exec_path(env=None)
<br>        Returns the sequence of directories that will be searched for the
<br>        named executable (similar to a shell) when launching a process.
<br>
<br>        *env* must be an environment variable dict or None.  If *env* is None,
<br>        os.environ will be used.
<br>
<br>    get_handle_inheritable(handle, /)
<br>        Get the close-on-exe flag of the specified file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    get_inheritable(fd, /)
<br>        Get the close-on-exe flag of the specified file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    get_terminal_size(...)
<br>        Return the size of the terminal window as (columns, lines).
<br>
<br>        The optional argument fd (default standard output) specifies
<br>        which file descriptor should be queried.
<br>
<br>        If the file descriptor is not connected to a terminal, an OSError
<br>        is thrown.
<br>
<br>        This function will only be defined if an implementation is
<br>        available for this system.
<br>
<br>        shutil.get_terminal_size is the high-level function which should
<br>        normally be used, os.get_terminal_size is the low-level implementation.
<br>
<br>    getcwd()
<br>        Return a unicode string representing the current working directory.
<br>
<br>    getcwdb()
<br>        Return a bytes string representing the current working directory.
<br>
<br>    getenv(key, default=None)
<br>        Get an environment variable, return None if it doesn't exist.
<br>        The optional second argument can specify an alternate default.
<br>        key, default and the result are str.
<br>
<br>    getlogin()
<br>        Return the actual login name.
<br>
<br>    getpid()
<br>        Return the current process id.
<br>
<br>    getppid()
<br>        Return the parent's process id.
<br>
<br>        If the parent process has already exited, Windows machines will still
<br>        return its id; others systems will return the id of the 'init' process (1).
<br>
<br>    isatty(fd, /)
<br>        Return True if the fd is connected to a terminal.
<br>
<br>        Return True if the file descriptor is an open file descriptor
<br>        connected to the slave end of a terminal.
<br>
<br>    kill(pid, signal, /)
<br>        Kill a process with a signal.
<br>
<br>    link(src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
<br>        Create a hard link to a file.
<br>
<br>        If either src_dir_fd or dst_dir_fd is not None, it should be a file
<br>          descriptor open to a directory, and the respective path string (src or dst)
<br>          should be relative; the path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        If follow_symlinks is False, and the last element of src is a symbolic
<br>          link, link will create a link to the symbolic link itself instead of the
<br>          file the link points to.
<br>        src_dir_fd, dst_dir_fd, and follow_symlinks may not be implemented on your
<br>          platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
<br>          NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    listdir(path=None)
<br>        Return a list containing the names of the files in the directory.
<br>
<br>        path can be specified as either str or bytes.  If path is bytes,
<br>          the filenames returned will also be bytes; in all other circumstances
<br>          the filenames returned will be str.
<br>        If path is None, uses the path='.'.
<br>        On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor;\
<br>          the file descriptor must refer to a directory.
<br>          If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>        The list is in arbitrary order.  It does not include the special
<br>        entries '.' and '..' even if they are present in the directory.
<br>
<br>    lseek(fd, position, how, /)
<br>        Set the position of a file descriptor.  Return the new position.
<br>
<br>        Return the new cursor position in number of bytes
<br>        relative to the beginning of the file.
<br>
<br>    lstat(path, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Perform a stat system call on the given path, without following symbolic links.
<br>
<br>        Like stat(), but do not follow symbolic links.
<br>        Equivalent to stat(path, follow_symlinks=False).
<br>
<br>    makedirs(name, mode=511, exist_ok=False)
<br>        makedirs(name [, mode=0o777][, exist_ok=False])
<br>
<br>        Super-mkdir; create a leaf directory and all intermediate ones.  Works like
<br>        mkdir, except that any intermediate path segment (not just the rightmost)
<br>        will be created if it does not exist. If the target directory already
<br>        exists, raise an OSError if exist_ok is False. Otherwise no exception is
<br>        raised.  This is recursive.
<br>
<br>    mkdir(path, mode=511, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Create a directory.
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>        The mode argument is ignored on Windows.
<br>
<br>    open(path, flags, mode=511, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Open a file for low level IO.  Returns a file descriptor (integer).
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    pipe()
<br>        Create a pipe.
<br>
<br>        Returns a tuple of two file descriptors:
<br>          (read_fd, write_fd)
<br>
<br>    popen(cmd, mode='r', buffering=-1)
<br>        # Supply os.popen()
<br>
<br>    putenv(name, value, /)
<br>        Change or add an environment variable.
<br>
<br>    read(fd, length, /)
<br>        Read from a file descriptor.  Returns a bytes object.
<br>
<br>    readlink(...)
<br>        readlink(path, *, dir_fd=None) -> path
<br>
<br>        Return a string representing the path to which the symbolic link points.
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    remove(path, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Remove a file (same as unlink()).
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    removedirs(name)
<br>        removedirs(name)
<br>
<br>        Super-rmdir; remove a leaf directory and all empty intermediate
<br>        ones.  Works like rmdir except that, if the leaf directory is
<br>        successfully removed, directories corresponding to rightmost path
<br>        segments will be pruned away until either the whole path is
<br>        consumed or an error occurs.  Errors during this latter phase are
<br>        ignored -- they generally mean that a directory was not empty.
<br>
<br>    rename(src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None)
<br>        Rename a file or directory.
<br>
<br>        If either src_dir_fd or dst_dir_fd is not None, it should be a file
<br>          descriptor open to a directory, and the respective path string (src or dst)
<br>          should be relative; the path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        src_dir_fd and dst_dir_fd, may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    renames(old, new)
<br>        renames(old, new)
<br>
<br>        Super-rename; create directories as necessary and delete any left
<br>        empty.  Works like rename, except creation of any intermediate
<br>        directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted
<br>        first.  After the rename, directories corresponding to rightmost
<br>        path segments of the old name will be pruned until either the
<br>        whole path is consumed or a nonempty directory is found.
<br>
<br>        Note: this function can fail with the new directory structure made
<br>        if you lack permissions needed to unlink the leaf directory or
<br>        file.
<br>
<br>    replace(src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None)
<br>        Rename a file or directory, overwriting the destination.
<br>
<br>        If either src_dir_fd or dst_dir_fd is not None, it should be a file
<br>          descriptor open to a directory, and the respective path string (src or dst)
<br>          should be relative; the path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        src_dir_fd and dst_dir_fd, may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError."
<br>
<br>    rmdir(path, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Remove a directory.
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    scandir(path=None)
<br>        Return an iterator of DirEntry objects for given path.
<br>
<br>        path can be specified as either str, bytes or path-like object.  If path
<br>        is bytes, the names of yielded DirEntry objects will also be bytes; in
<br>        all other circumstances they will be str.
<br>
<br>        If path is None, uses the path='.'.
<br>
<br>    set_handle_inheritable(handle, inheritable, /)
<br>        Set the inheritable flag of the specified handle.
<br>
<br>    set_inheritable(fd, inheritable, /)
<br>        Set the inheritable flag of the specified file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    spawnl(mode, file, *args)
<br>        spawnl(mode, file, *args) -> integer
<br>
<br>        Execute file with arguments from args in a subprocess.
<br>        If mode == P_NOWAIT return the pid of the process.
<br>        If mode == P_WAIT return the process's exit code if it exits normally;
<br>        otherwise return -SIG, where SIG is the signal that killed it.
<br>
<br>    spawnle(mode, file, *args)
<br>        spawnle(mode, file, *args, env) -> integer
<br>
<br>        Execute file with arguments from args in a subprocess with the
<br>        supplied environment.
<br>        If mode == P_NOWAIT return the pid of the process.
<br>        If mode == P_WAIT return the process's exit code if it exits normally;
<br>        otherwise return -SIG, where SIG is the signal that killed it.
<br>
<br>    spawnv(mode, path, argv, /)
<br>        Execute the program specified by path in a new process.
<br>
<br>        mode
<br>          Mode of process creation.
<br>        path
<br>          Path of executable file.
<br>        argv
<br>          Tuple or list of strings.
<br>
<br>    spawnve(mode, path, argv, env, /)
<br>        Execute the program specified by path in a new process.
<br>
<br>        mode
<br>          Mode of process creation.
<br>        path
<br>          Path of executable file.
<br>        argv
<br>          Tuple or list of strings.
<br>        env
<br>          Dictionary of strings mapping to strings.
<br>
<br>    startfile(filepath, operation=None)
<br>        startfile(filepath [, operation])
<br>
<br>        Start a file with its associated application.
<br>
<br>        When "operation" is not specified or "open", this acts like
<br>        double-clicking the file in Explorer, or giving the file name as an
<br>        argument to the DOS "start" command: the file is opened with whatever
<br>        application (if any) its extension is associated.
<br>        When another "operation" is given, it specifies what should be done with
<br>        the file.  A typical operation is "print".
<br>
<br>        startfile returns as soon as the associated application is launched.
<br>        There is no option to wait for the application to close, and no way
<br>        to retrieve the application's exit status.
<br>
<br>        The filepath is relative to the current directory.  If you want to use
<br>        an absolute path, make sure the first character is not a slash ("/");
<br>        the underlying Win32 ShellExecute function doesn't work if it is.
<br>
<br>    stat(path, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
<br>        Perform a stat system call on the given path.
<br>
<br>          path
<br>            Path to be examined; can be string, bytes, path-like object or
<br>            open-file-descriptor int.
<br>          dir_fd
<br>            If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>            and path should be a relative string; path will then be relative to
<br>            that directory.
<br>          follow_symlinks
<br>            If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
<br>            stat will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
<br>            the link points to.
<br>
<br>        dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
<br>          on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
<br>          NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>        It's an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
<br>          an open file descriptor.
<br>
<br>    strerror(code, /)
<br>        Translate an error code to a message string.
<br>
<br>    symlink(src, dst, target_is_directory=False, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Create a symbolic link pointing to src named dst.
<br>
<br>        target_is_directory is required on Windows if the target is to be
<br>          interpreted as a directory.  (On Windows, symlink requires
<br>          Windows 6.0 or greater, and raises a NotImplementedError otherwise.)
<br>          target_is_directory is ignored on non-Windows platforms.
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    system(command)
<br>        Execute the command in a subshell.
<br>
<br>    times()
<br>        Return a collection containing process timing information.
<br>
<br>        The object returned behaves like a named tuple with these fields:
<br>          (utime, stime, cutime, cstime, elapsed_time)
<br>        All fields are floating point numbers.
<br>
<br>    truncate(path, length)
<br>        Truncate a file, specified by path, to a specific length.
<br>
<br>        On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
<br>          If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
<br>
<br>    umask(mask, /)
<br>        Set the current numeric umask and return the previous umask.
<br>
<br>    unlink(path, *, dir_fd=None)
<br>        Remove a file (same as remove()).
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
<br>          If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    urandom(size, /)
<br>        Return a bytes object containing random bytes suitable for cryptographic use.
<br>
<br>    utime(path, times=None, *, ns=None, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
<br>        Set the access and modified time of path.
<br>
<br>        path may always be specified as a string.
<br>        On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
<br>          If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
<br>
<br>        If times is not None, it must be a tuple (atime, mtime);
<br>            atime and mtime should be expressed as float seconds since the epoch.
<br>        If ns is specified, it must be a tuple (atime_ns, mtime_ns);
<br>            atime_ns and mtime_ns should be expressed as integer nanoseconds
<br>            since the epoch.
<br>        If times is None and ns is unspecified, utime uses the current time.
<br>        Specifying tuples for both times and ns is an error.
<br>
<br>        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
<br>          and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
<br>        If follow_symlinks is False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic
<br>          link, utime will modify the symbolic link itself instead of the file the
<br>          link points to.
<br>        It is an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path
<br>          as an open file descriptor.
<br>        dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be available on your platform.
<br>          If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.
<br>
<br>    waitpid(pid, options, /)
<br>        Wait for completion of a given process.
<br>
<br>        Returns a tuple of information regarding the process:
<br>            (pid, status << 8)
<br>
<br>        The options argument is ignored on Windows.
<br>
<br>    walk(top, topdown=True, onerror=None, followlinks=False)
<br>        Directory tree generator.
<br>
<br>        For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top
<br>        itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple
<br>
<br>            dirpath, dirnames, filenames
<br>
<br>        dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of
<br>        the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').
<br>        filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.
<br>        Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.
<br>        To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in
<br>        dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).
<br>
<br>        If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
<br>        directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
<br>        (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple
<br>        for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
<br>        subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).
<br>
<br>        When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place
<br>        (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the
<br>        subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the
<br>        search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying dirnames when
<br>        topdown is false is ineffective, since the directories in dirnames have
<br>        already been generated by the time dirnames itself is generated. No matter
<br>        the value of topdown, the list of subdirectories is retrieved before the
<br>        tuples for the directory and its subdirectories are generated.
<br>
<br>        By default errors from the os.scandir() call are ignored.  If
<br>        optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it
<br>        will be called with one argument, an OSError instance.  It can
<br>        report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception
<br>        to abort the walk.  Note that the filename is available as the
<br>        filename attribute of the exception object.
<br>
<br>        By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on
<br>        systems that support them.  In order to get this functionality, set the
<br>        optional argument 'followlinks' to true.
<br>
<br>        Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the
<br>        current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never
<br>        changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't
<br>        either.
<br>
<br>        Example:
<br>
<br>        import os
<br>        from os.path import join, getsize
<br>        for root, dirs, files in os.walk('python/Lib/email'):
<br>            print(root, "consumes", end="")
<br>            print(sum([getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files]), end="")
<br>            print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")
<br>            if 'CVS' in dirs:
<br>                dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories
<br>
<br>    write(fd, data, /)
<br>        Write a bytes object to a file descriptor.

<br>NAME
<br>    requests
<br>
<br>DESCRIPTION
<br>    Requests HTTP Library
<br>    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<br>    Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
<br>    usage:
<br>
<br>       >>> import requests
<br>       >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
<br>       >>> r.status_code
<br>       200
<br>       >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
<br>       True
<br>
<br>    ... or POST:
<br>
<br>       >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
<br>       >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
<br>       >>> print(r.text)
<br>       {
<br>         ...
<br>         "form": {
<br>           "key2": "value2",
<br>           "key1": "value1"
<br>         },
<br>         ...
<br>       }
<br>
<br>    The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
<br>    is at <http://python-requests.org>.

<br>Help on module subprocess:
<br>
<br>NAME
<br>    subprocess - Subprocesses with accessible I/O streams
<br>
<br>DESCRIPTION
<br>    This module allows you to spawn processes, connect to their
<br>    input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
<br>
<br>    For a complete description of this module see the Python documentation.
<br>
<br>    Main API
<br>    ========
<br>    run(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns a
<br>              CompletedProcess instance.
<br>    Popen(...): A class for flexibly executing a command in a new process
<br>
<br>    Constants
<br>    ---------
<br>    DEVNULL: Special value that indicates that os.devnull should be used
<br>    PIPE:    Special value that indicates a pipe should be created
<br>    STDOUT:  Special value that indicates that stderr should go to stdout
<br>
<br>
<br>    Older API
<br>    =========
<br>    call(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns
<br>        the return code.
<br>    check_call(...): Same as call() but raises CalledProcessError()
<br>        if return code is not 0
<br>    check_output(...): Same as check_call() but returns the contents of
<br>        stdout instead of a return code
<br>    getoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
<br>        then returns the output
<br>    getstatusoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
<br>        then returns a (exitcode, output) tuple

<br>     |
<br>     |    shell: If true, the command will be executed through the shell.
<br>     |
<br>     |    cwd: Sets the current directory before the child is executed.
<br>     |
<br>     |    env: Defines the environment variables for the new process.
<br>     |
<br>     |    text: If true, decode stdin, stdout and stderr using the given encoding
<br>     |        (if set) or the system default otherwise.

<br>     |
<br>     |  Attributes:
<br>     |      stdin, stdout, stderr, pid, returncode

<br>     |      Create new Popen instance.
<br>     |
<br>     |  communicate(self, input=None, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Interact with process: Send data to stdin and close it.
<br>     |      Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is
<br>     |      reached.  Wait for process to terminate.
<br>     |
<br>     |      The optional "input" argument should be data to be sent to the
<br>     |      child process, or None, if no data should be sent to the child.
<br>     |      communicate() returns a tuple (stdout, stderr).
<br>     |
<br>     |      By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any
<br>     |      "input" should be bytes, and the (stdout, stderr) will be bytes.
<br>     |      If in text mode (indicated by self.text_mode), any "input" should
<br>     |      be a string, and (stdout, stderr) will be strings decoded
<br>     |      according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
<br>     |      is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or
<br>     |      universal_newlines.
<br>     |
<br>     |  kill = terminate(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  poll(self)
<br>     |      Check if child process has terminated. Set and return returncode
<br>     |      attribute.
<br>     |
<br>     |  send_signal(self, sig)
<br>     |      Send a signal to the process.
<br>     |
<br>     |  terminate(self)
<br>     |      Terminates the process.
<br>     |
<br>     |  wait(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait for child process to terminate; returns self.returncode.

<br>FUNCTIONS
<br>    call(*popenargs, timeout=None, **kwargs)
<br>        Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete or
<br>        timeout, then return the returncode attribute.
<br>
<br>        The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:
<br>
<br>        retcode = call(["ls", "-l"])
<br>
<br>    check_call(*popenargs, **kwargs)
<br>        Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete.  If
<br>        the exit code was zero then return, otherwise raise
<br>        CalledProcessError.  The CalledProcessError object will have the
<br>        return code in the returncode attribute.
<br>
<br>        The arguments are the same as for the call function.  Example:
<br>
<br>        check_call(["ls", "-l"])
<br>
<br>    check_output(*popenargs, timeout=None, **kwargs)
<br>        Run command with arguments and return its output.
<br>
<br>        If the exit code was non-zero it raises a CalledProcessError.  The
<br>        CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode
<br>        attribute and output in the output attribute.
<br>
<br>        The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:
<br>
<br>        >>> check_output(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"])
<br>        b'crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Oct 18  2007 /dev/null\n'
<br>
<br>        The stdout argument is not allowed as it is used internally.
<br>        To capture standard error in the result, use stderr=STDOUT.
<br>
<br>        >>> check_output(["/bin/sh", "-c",
<br>        ...               "ls -l non_existent_file ; exit 0"],
<br>        ...              stderr=STDOUT)
<br>        b'ls: non_existent_file: No such file or directory\n'
<br>
<br>        There is an additional optional argument, "input", allowing you to
<br>        pass a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
<br>        you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
<br>        it too will be used internally.  Example:
<br>
<br>        >>> check_output(["sed", "-e", "s/foo/bar/"],
<br>        ...              input=b"when in the course of fooman events\n")
<br>        b'when in the course of barman events\n'
<br>
<br>        By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input"
<br>        should be bytes, and the return value wil be bytes.  If in text mode,
<br>        any "input" should be a string, and the return value will be a string
<br>        decoded according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
<br>        is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.
<br>
<br>    getoutput(cmd)
<br>        Return output (stdout or stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.
<br>
<br>        Like getstatusoutput(), except the exit status is ignored and the return
<br>        value is a string containing the command's output.  Example:
<br>
<br>        >>> import subprocess
<br>        >>> subprocess.getoutput('ls /bin/ls')
<br>        '/bin/ls'
<br>
<br>    getstatusoutput(cmd)
<br>        Return (exitcode, output) of executing cmd in a shell.
<br>
<br>        Execute the string 'cmd' in a shell with 'check_output' and
<br>        return a 2-tuple (status, output). The locale encoding is used
<br>        to decode the output and process newlines.
<br>
<br>        A trailing newline is stripped from the output.
<br>        The exit status for the command can be interpreted
<br>        according to the rules for the function 'wait'. Example:
<br>
<br>        >>> import subprocess
<br>        >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
<br>        (0, '/bin/ls')
<br>        >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('cat /bin/junk')
<br>        (1, 'cat: /bin/junk: No such file or directory')
<br>        >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/junk')
<br>        (127, 'sh: /bin/junk: not found')
<br>        >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/kill $$')
<br>        (-15, '')
<br>
<br>    run(*popenargs, input=None, capture_output=False, timeout=None, check=False, **kwargs)
<br>        Run command with arguments and return a CompletedProcess instance.
<br>
<br>        The returned instance will have attributes args, returncode, stdout and
<br>        stderr. By default, stdout and stderr are not captured, and those attributes
<br>        will be None. Pass stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE in order to capture them.
<br>
<br>        If check is True and the exit code was non-zero, it raises a
<br>        CalledProcessError. The CalledProcessError object will have the return code
<br>        in the returncode attribute, and output & stderr attributes if those streams
<br>        were captured.
<br>
<br>        If timeout is given, and the process takes too long, a TimeoutExpired
<br>        exception will be raised.
<br>
<br>        There is an optional argument "input", allowing you to
<br>        pass bytes or a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
<br>        you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
<br>        it will be used internally.
<br>
<br>        By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input" should
<br>        be bytes, and the stdout and stderr will be bytes. If in text mode, any
<br>        "input" should be a string, and stdout and stderr will be strings decoded
<br>        according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode is
<br>        triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.
<br>
<br>        The other arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.

<br>MODULE REFERENCE
<br>    https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys
<br>
<br>    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
<br>    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
<br>    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
<br>    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
<br>    location listed above.
<br>
<br>DESCRIPTION
<br>    This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
<br>    interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
<br>
<br>    Dynamic objects:
<br>
<br>    argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
<br>    path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
<br>    modules -- dictionary of loaded modules
<br>
<br>    displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
<br>    excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
<br>      To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
<br>      top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.
<br>
<br>    stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
<br>    stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
<br>    stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
<br>      By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
<br>      to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.
<br>
<br>    last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
<br>    last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
<br>    last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
<br>      These three are only available in an interactive session after a
<br>      traceback has been printed.
<br>
<br>    Static objects:
<br>
<br>    builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
<br>    copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
<br>    exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
<br>    executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
<br>    float_info -- a struct sequence with information about the float implementation.
<br>    float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
<br>    hash_info -- a struct sequence with information about the hash algorithm.
<br>    hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
<br>    implementation -- Python implementation information.
<br>    int_info -- a struct sequence with information about the int implementation.
<br>    maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
<br>    maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
<br>    platform -- platform identifier
<br>    prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
<br>    thread_info -- a struct sequence with information about the thread implementation.
<br>    version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
<br>    version_info -- version information as a named tuple
<br>    dllhandle -- [Windows only] integer handle of the Python DLL
<br>    winver -- [Windows only] version number of the Python DLL
<br>    _enablelegacywindowsfsencoding -- [Windows only]
<br>    __stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!
<br>    __stdout__ -- the original stdout; don't touch!
<br>    __stderr__ -- the original stderr; don't touch!
<br>    __displayhook__ -- the original displayhook; don't touch!
<br>    __excepthook__ -- the original excepthook; don't touch!
<br>
<br>    Functions:
<br>
<br>    displayhook() -- print an object to the screen, and save it in builtins._
<br>    excepthook() -- print an exception and its traceback to sys.stderr
<br>    exc_info() -- return thread-safe information about the current exception
<br>    exit() -- exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit
<br>    getdlopenflags() -- returns flags to be used for dlopen() calls
<br>    getprofile() -- get the global profiling function
<br>    getrefcount() -- return the reference count for an object (plus one :-)
<br>    getrecursionlimit() -- return the max recursion depth for the interpreter
<br>    getsizeof() -- return the size of an object in bytes
<br>    gettrace() -- get the global debug tracing function
<br>    setcheckinterval() -- control how often the interpreter checks for events

<br>
<br>FUNCTIONS
<br>    __breakpointhook__ = breakpointhook(...)
<br>        breakpointhook(*args, **kws)
<br>
<br>        This hook function is called by built-in breakpoint().
<br>
<br>    __displayhook__ = displayhook(...)
<br>        displayhook(object) -> None
<br>
<br>        Print an object to sys.stdout and also save it in builtins._
<br>
<br>    __excepthook__ = excepthook(...)
<br>        excepthook(exctype, value, traceback) -> None
<br>
<br>        Handle an exception by displaying it with a traceback on sys.stderr.
<br>
<br>    breakpointhook(...)
<br>        breakpointhook(*args, **kws)
<br>
<br>        This hook function is called by built-in breakpoint().
<br>
<br>    call_tracing(...)
<br>        call_tracing(func, args) -> object
<br>
<br>        Call func(*args), while tracing is enabled.  The tracing state is
<br>        saved, and restored afterwards.  This is intended to be called from
<br>        a debugger from a checkpoint, to recursively debug some other code.
<br>
<br>    callstats(...)
<br>        callstats() -> tuple of integers
<br>
<br>        Return a tuple of function call statistics, if CALL_PROFILE was defined
<br>        when Python was built.  Otherwise, return None.
<br>
<br>        When enabled, this function returns detailed, implementation-specific
<br>        details about the number of function calls executed. The return value is
<br>        a 11-tuple where the entries in the tuple are counts of:
<br>        0. all function calls
<br>        1. calls to PyFunction_Type objects
<br>        2. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
<br>        3. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
<br>           and bypass PyEval_EvalCodeEx()
<br>        4. PyMethod calls
<br>        5. PyMethod calls on bound methods
<br>        6. PyType calls
<br>        7. PyCFunction calls
<br>        8. generator calls
<br>        9. All other calls
<br>        10. Number of stack pops performed by call_function()
<br>
<br>    exc_info(...)
<br>        exc_info() -> (type, value, traceback)
<br>
<br>        Return information about the most recent exception caught by an except
<br>        clause in the current stack frame or in an older stack frame.
<br>
<br>    excepthook(...)
<br>        excepthook(exctype, value, traceback) -> None
<br>
<br>        Handle an exception by displaying it with a traceback on sys.stderr.
<br>
<br>    exit(...)
<br>        exit([status])
<br>
<br>        Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status).
<br>        If the status is omitted or None, it defaults to zero (i.e., success).
<br>        If the status is an integer, it will be used as the system exit status.
<br>        If it is another kind of object, it will be printed and the system
<br>        exit status will be one (i.e., failure).
<br>
<br>    get_asyncgen_hooks(...)
<br>        get_asyncgen_hooks()
<br>
<br>        Return a namedtuple of installed asynchronous generators hooks (firstiter, finalizer).
<br>
<br>    get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()
<br>        Check status of origin tracking for coroutine objects in this thread.
<br>
<br>    get_coroutine_wrapper(...)
<br>        get_coroutine_wrapper()
<br>
<br>        Return the wrapper for coroutine objects set by sys.set_coroutine_wrapper.
<br>
<br>    getallocatedblocks(...)
<br>        getallocatedblocks() -> integer
<br>
<br>        Return the number of memory blocks currently allocated, regardless of their
<br>        size.
<br>
<br>    getcheckinterval(...)
<br>        getcheckinterval() -> current check interval; see setcheckinterval().
<br>
<br>    getdefaultencoding(...)
<br>        getdefaultencoding() -> string
<br>
<br>        Return the current default string encoding used by the Unicode
<br>        implementation.
<br>
<br>    getfilesystemencodeerrors(...)
<br>        getfilesystemencodeerrors() -> string
<br>
<br>        Return the error mode used to convert Unicode filenames in
<br>        operating system filenames.
<br>
<br>    getfilesystemencoding(...)
<br>        getfilesystemencoding() -> string
<br>
<br>        Return the encoding used to convert Unicode filenames in
<br>        operating system filenames.
<br>
<br>    getprofile(...)
<br>        getprofile()
<br>
<br>        Return the profiling function set with sys.setprofile.
<br>        See the profiler chapter in the library manual.
<br>
<br>    getrecursionlimit(...)
<br>        getrecursionlimit()
<br>
<br>        Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth
<br>        of the Python interpreter stack.  This limit prevents infinite
<br>        recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing Python.
<br>
<br>    getrefcount(...)
<br>        getrefcount(object) -> integer
<br>
<br>        Return the reference count of object.  The count returned is generally
<br>        one higher than you might expect, because it includes the (temporary)
<br>        reference as an argument to getrefcount().
<br>
<br>    getsizeof(...)
<br>        getsizeof(object, default) -> int
<br>
<br>        Return the size of object in bytes.
<br>
<br>    getswitchinterval(...)
<br>        getswitchinterval() -> current thread switch interval; see setswitchinterval().
<br>
<br>    gettrace(...)
<br>        gettrace()
<br>
<br>        Return the global debug tracing function set with sys.settrace.
<br>        See the debugger chapter in the library manual.
<br>
<br>    getwindowsversion(...)
<br>        getwindowsversion()
<br>
<br>        Return information about the running version of Windows as a named tuple.
<br>        The members are named: major, minor, build, platform, service_pack,
<br>        service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and product_type. For
<br>        backward compatibility, only the first 5 items are available by indexing.
<br>        All elements are numbers, except service_pack and platform_type which are
<br>        strings, and platform_version which is a 3-tuple. Platform is always 2.
<br>        Product_type may be 1 for a workstation, 2 for a domain controller, 3 for a
<br>        server. Platform_version is a 3-tuple containing a version number that is
<br>        intended for identifying the OS rather than feature detection.
<br>
<br>    intern(...)
<br>        intern(string) -> string
<br>
<br>        ``Intern'' the given string.  This enters the string in the (global)
<br>        table of interned strings whose purpose is to speed up dictionary lookups.
<br>        Return the string itself or the previously interned string object with the
<br>        same value.
<br>
<br>    is_finalizing(...)
<br>        is_finalizing()
<br>        Return True if Python is exiting.
<br>
<br>    set_asyncgen_hooks(...)
<br>        set_asyncgen_hooks(*, firstiter=None, finalizer=None)
<br>
<br>        Set a finalizer for async generators objects.
<br>
<br>    set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth(depth)
<br>        Enable or disable origin tracking for coroutine objects in this thread.
<br>
<br>        Coroutine objects will track 'depth' frames of traceback information about
<br>        where they came from, available in their cr_origin attribute. Set depth of 0
<br>        to disable.
<br>
<br>    set_coroutine_wrapper(...)
<br>        set_coroutine_wrapper(wrapper)
<br>
<br>        Set a wrapper for coroutine objects.
<br>
<br>    setcheckinterval(...)
<br>        setcheckinterval(n)
<br>
<br>        Tell the Python interpreter to check for asynchronous events every
<br>        n instructions.  This also affects how often thread switches occur.
<br>
<br>    setprofile(...)
<br>        setprofile(function)
<br>
<br>        Set the profiling function.  It will be called on each function call
<br>        and return.  See the profiler chapter in the library manual.
<br>
<br>    setrecursionlimit(...)
<br>        setrecursionlimit(n)
<br>
<br>        Set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to n.  This
<br>        limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C
<br>        stack and crashing Python.  The highest possible limit is platform-
<br>        dependent.
<br>
<br>    setswitchinterval(...)
<br>        setswitchinterval(n)
<br>
<br>        Set the ideal thread switching delay inside the Python interpreter
<br>        The actual frequency of switching threads can be lower if the
<br>        interpreter executes long sequences of uninterruptible code
<br>        (this is implementation-specific and workload-dependent).
<br>
<br>        The parameter must represent the desired switching delay in seconds
<br>        A typical value is 0.005 (5 milliseconds).
<br>
<br>    settrace(...)
<br>        settrace(function)
<br>
<br>        Set the global debug tracing function.  It will be called on each
<br>        function call.  See the debugger chapter in the library manual.

<br>    class Barrier(builtins.object)
<br>     |  Barrier(parties, action=None, timeout=None)
<br>     |
<br>     |  Implements a Barrier.
<br>     |
<br>     |  Useful for synchronizing a fixed number of threads at known synchronization
<br>     |  points.  Threads block on 'wait()' and are simultaneously once they have all
<br>     |  made that call.
<br>     |
<br>     |  Methods defined here:
<br>     |
<br>     |  __init__(self, parties, action=None, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Create a barrier, initialised to 'parties' threads.
<br>     |
<br>     |      'action' is a callable which, when supplied, will be called by one of
<br>     |      the threads after they have all entered the barrier and just prior to
<br>     |      releasing them all. If a 'timeout' is provided, it is uses as the
<br>     |      default for all subsequent 'wait()' calls.
<br>     |
<br>     |  abort(self)
<br>     |      Place the barrier into a 'broken' state.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Useful in case of error.  Any currently waiting threads and threads
<br>     |      attempting to 'wait()' will have BrokenBarrierError raised.
<br>     |
<br>     |  reset(self)
<br>     |      Reset the barrier to the initial state.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Any threads currently waiting will get the BrokenBarrier exception
<br>     |      raised.
<br>     |
<br>     |  wait(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait for the barrier.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the specified number of threads have started waiting, they are all
<br>     |      simultaneously awoken. If an 'action' was provided for the barrier, one
<br>     |      of the threads will have executed that callback prior to returning.
<br>     |      Returns an individual index number from 0 to 'parties-1'.

<br>    class BoundedSemaphore(Semaphore)
<br>     |  BoundedSemaphore(value=1)
<br>     |
<br>     |  Implements a bounded semaphore.
<br>     |
<br>     |  A bounded semaphore checks to make sure its current value doesn't exceed its
<br>     |  initial value. If it does, ValueError is raised. In most situations
<br>     |  semaphores are used to guard resources with limited capacity.
<br>     |
<br>     |  If the semaphore is released too many times it's a sign of a bug. If not
<br>     |  given, value defaults to 1.
<br>     |
<br>     |  Like regular semaphores, bounded semaphores manage a counter representing
<br>     |  the number of release() calls minus the number of acquire() calls, plus an
<br>     |  initial value. The acquire() method blocks if necessary until it can return
<br>     |  without making the counter negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

<br>     |
<br>     |  release(self)
<br>     |      Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
<br>     |      to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If the number of releases exceeds the number of acquires,
<br>     |      raise a ValueError.

<br>     |  Methods inherited from Semaphore:
<br>     |
<br>     |  __enter__ = acquire(self, blocking=True, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Acquire a semaphore, decrementing the internal counter by one.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked without arguments: if the internal counter is larger than
<br>     |      zero on entry, decrement it by one and return immediately. If it is zero
<br>     |      on entry, block, waiting until some other thread has called release() to
<br>     |      make it larger than zero. This is done with proper interlocking so that
<br>     |      if multiple acquire() calls are blocked, release() will wake exactly one
<br>     |      of them up. The implementation may pick one at random, so the order in
<br>     |      which blocked threads are awakened should not be relied on. There is no
<br>     |      return value in this case.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with blocking set to true, do the same thing as when called
<br>     |      without arguments, and return true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with blocking set to false, do not block. If a call without
<br>     |      an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
<br>     |      same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with a timeout other than None, it will block for at
<br>     |      most timeout seconds.  If acquire does not complete successfully in
<br>     |      that interval, return false.  Return true otherwise.
<br>     |
<br>     |  __exit__(self, t, v, tb)

<br>     |
<br>     |  Class that implements a condition variable.
<br>     |
<br>     |  A condition variable allows one or more threads to wait until they are
<br>     |  notified by another thread.
<br>     |
<br>     |  If the lock argument is given and not None, it must be a Lock or RLock
<br>     |  object, and it is used as the underlying lock. Otherwise, a new RLock object
<br>     |  is created and used as the underlying lock.
<br>     |
<br>     |  Methods defined here:
<br>     |
<br>     |  __enter__(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  __exit__(self, *args)

<br>     |  __init__(self, lock=None)
<br>     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
<br>     |
<br>     |  __repr__(self)
<br>     |      Return repr(self).
<br>     |
<br>     |  notify(self, n=1)
<br>     |      Wake up one or more threads waiting on this condition, if any.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If the calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is
<br>     |      called, a RuntimeError is raised.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method wakes up at most n of the threads waiting for the condition
<br>     |      variable; it is a no-op if no threads are waiting.
<br>     |
<br>     |  notifyAll = notify_all(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  notify_all(self)
<br>     |      Wake up all threads waiting on this condition.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If the calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method
<br>     |      is called, a RuntimeError is raised.
<br>     |
<br>     |  wait(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait until notified or until a timeout occurs.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If the calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is
<br>     |      called, a RuntimeError is raised.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is
<br>     |      awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call for the same condition
<br>     |      variable in another thread, or until the optional timeout occurs. Once
<br>     |      awakened or timed out, it re-acquires the lock and returns.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
<br>     |      floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
<br>     |      (or fractions thereof).
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the underlying lock is an RLock, it is not released using its
<br>     |      release() method, since this may not actually unlock the lock when it
<br>     |      was acquired multiple times recursively. Instead, an internal interface
<br>     |      of the RLock class is used, which really unlocks it even when it has
<br>     |      been recursively acquired several times. Another internal interface is
<br>     |      then used to restore the recursion level when the lock is reacquired.
<br>     |
<br>     |  wait_for(self, predicate, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait until a condition evaluates to True.
<br>     |
<br>     |      predicate should be a callable which result will be interpreted as a
<br>     |      boolean value.  A timeout may be provided giving the maximum time to
<br>     |      wait.

<br>     |  clear(self)
<br>     |      Reset the internal flag to false.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Subsequently, threads calling wait() will block until set() is called to
<br>     |      set the internal flag to true again.

<br>     |      Set the internal flag to true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      All threads waiting for it to become true are awakened. Threads
<br>     |      that call wait() once the flag is true will not block at all.
<br>     |
<br>     |  wait(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Block until the internal flag is true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If the internal flag is true on entry, return immediately. Otherwise,
<br>     |      block until another thread calls set() to set the flag to true, or until
<br>     |      the optional timeout occurs.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
<br>     |      floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
<br>     |      (or fractions thereof).
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method returns the internal flag on exit, so it will always return

<br>     |
<br>     |  acquire(self, blocking=True, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Acquire a semaphore, decrementing the internal counter by one.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked without arguments: if the internal counter is larger than
<br>     |      zero on entry, decrement it by one and return immediately. If it is zero
<br>     |      on entry, block, waiting until some other thread has called release() to
<br>     |      make it larger than zero. This is done with proper interlocking so that
<br>     |      if multiple acquire() calls are blocked, release() will wake exactly one
<br>     |      of them up. The implementation may pick one at random, so the order in
<br>     |      which blocked threads are awakened should not be relied on. There is no
<br>     |      return value in this case.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with blocking set to true, do the same thing as when called
<br>     |      without arguments, and return true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with blocking set to false, do not block. If a call without
<br>     |      an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
<br>     |      same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When invoked with a timeout other than None, it will block for at
<br>     |      most timeout seconds.  If acquire does not complete successfully in
<br>     |      that interval, return false.  Return true otherwise.
<br>     |
<br>     |  release(self)
<br>     |      Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
<br>     |      to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.

<br>    class Thread(builtins.object)
<br>     |  Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs=None, *, daemon=None)
<br>     |
<br>     |  A class that represents a thread of control.
<br>     |
<br>     |  This class can be safely subclassed in a limited fashion. There are two ways
<br>     |  to specify the activity: by passing a callable object to the constructor, or
<br>     |  by overriding the run() method in a subclass.
<br>     |
<br>     |  Methods defined here:
<br>     |
<br>     |  __init__(self, group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs=None, *, daemon=None)
<br>     |      This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. Arguments are:
<br>     |
<br>     |      *group* should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup
<br>     |      class is implemented.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *target* is the callable object to be invoked by the run()
<br>     |      method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of
<br>     |      the form "Thread-N" where N is a small decimal number.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *args* is the argument tuple for the target invocation. Defaults to ().
<br>     |
<br>     |      *kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target
<br>     |      invocation. Defaults to {}.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke
<br>     |      the base class constructor (Thread.__init__()) before doing anything
<br>     |      else to the thread.
<br>     |
<br>     |  __repr__(self)
<br>     |      Return repr(self).
<br>     |
<br>     |  getName(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  isAlive = is_alive(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  isDaemon(self)
<br>     |
<br>     |  is_alive(self)
<br>     |      Return whether the thread is alive.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just
<br>     |      after the run() method terminates. The module function enumerate()
<br>     |      returns a list of all alive threads.
<br>     |
<br>     |  join(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait until the thread terminates.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is
<br>     |      called terminates -- either normally or through an unhandled exception
<br>     |      or until the optional timeout occurs.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
<br>     |      floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
<br>     |      (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call
<br>     |      isAlive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the
<br>     |      thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
<br>     |      block until the thread terminates.
<br>     |
<br>     |      A thread can be join()ed many times.
<br>     |
<br>     |      join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current
<br>     |      thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a
<br>     |      thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same
<br>     |      exception.
<br>     |
<br>     |  run(self)
<br>     |      Method representing the thread's activity.
<br>     |
<br>     |      You may override this method in a subclass. The standard run() method
<br>     |      invokes the callable object passed to the object's constructor as the
<br>     |      target argument, if any, with sequential and keyword arguments taken
<br>     |      from the args and kwargs arguments, respectively.
<br>     |
<br>     |  setDaemon(self, daemonic)
<br>     |
<br>     |  setName(self, name)
<br>     |
<br>     |  start(self)
<br>     |      Start the thread's activity.
<br>     |
<br>     |      It must be called at most once per thread object. It arranges for the
<br>     |      object's run() method to be invoked in a separate thread of control.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method will raise a RuntimeError if called more than once on the
<br>     |      same thread object.

<br>     |      raised. Its initial value is inherited from the creating thread; the
<br>     |      main thread is not a daemon thread and therefore all threads created in
<br>     |      the main thread default to daemon = False.

<br>        The func will be passed to sys.setprofile() for each thread, before its

<br>
<br>    settrace(func)

<br>
<br>    stack_size(...)
<br>        stack_size([size]) -> size
<br>
<br>        Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The
<br>        optional size argument specifies the stack size (in bytes) to be used
<br>        for subsequently created threads, and must be 0 (use platform or
<br>        configured default) or a positive integer value of at least 32,768 (32k).
<br>        If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, a ThreadError
<br>        exception is raised.  If the specified size is invalid, a ValueError
<br>        exception is raised, and the stack size is unmodified.  32k bytes
<br>         currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee
<br>        sufficient stack space for the interpreter itself.
<br>
<br>        Note that some platforms may have particular restrictions on values for
<br>        the stack size, such as requiring a minimum stack size larger than 32 KiB or
<br>        requiring allocation in multiples of the system memory page size
<br>        - platform documentation should be referred to for more information
<br>        (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
<br>        the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).

<br>Help on built-in module time:
<br>
<br>NAME
<br>    time - This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.
<br>
<br>DESCRIPTION
<br>    There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
<br>    of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
<br>    or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
<br>    The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
<br>    The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).
<br>
<br>    The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
<br>    The tuple items are:
<br>      year (including century, e.g. 1998)
<br>      month (1-12)
<br>      day (1-31)
<br>      hours (0-23)
<br>      minutes (0-59)
<br>      seconds (0-59)
<br>      weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
<br>      Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
<br>      DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
<br>    If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
<br>    if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
<br>    if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.

<br>
<br>FUNCTIONS
<br>    asctime(...)
<br>        asctime([tuple]) -> string
<br>
<br>        Convert a time tuple to a string, e.g. 'Sat Jun 06 16:26:11 1998'.
<br>        When the time tuple is not present, current time as returned by localtime()
<br>        is used.
<br>
<br>    clock(...)
<br>        clock() -> floating point number
<br>
<br>        Return the CPU time or real time since the start of the process or since
<br>        the first call to clock().  This has as much precision as the system
<br>        records.
<br>
<br>    ctime(...)
<br>        ctime(seconds) -> string
<br>
<br>        Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
<br>        This is equivalent to asctime(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
<br>        not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
<br>
<br>    get_clock_info(...)
<br>        get_clock_info(name: str) -> dict
<br>
<br>        Get information of the specified clock.
<br>
<br>    gmtime(...)
<br>        gmtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min,
<br>                               tm_sec, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst)
<br>
<br>        Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a.
<br>        GMT).  When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
<br>
<br>        If the platform supports the tm_gmtoff and tm_zone, they are available as
<br>        attributes only.
<br>
<br>    localtime(...)
<br>        localtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year,tm_mon,tm_mday,tm_hour,tm_min,
<br>                                  tm_sec,tm_wday,tm_yday,tm_isdst)
<br>
<br>        Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing local time.
<br>        When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
<br>
<br>    mktime(...)
<br>        mktime(tuple) -> floating point number
<br>
<br>        Convert a time tuple in local time to seconds since the Epoch.
<br>        Note that mktime(gmtime(0)) will not generally return zero for most
<br>        time zones; instead the returned value will either be equal to that
<br>        of the timezone or altzone attributes on the time module.
<br>
<br>    monotonic(...)
<br>        monotonic() -> float
<br>
<br>        Monotonic clock, cannot go backward.
<br>
<br>    monotonic_ns(...)
<br>        monotonic_ns() -> int
<br>
<br>        Monotonic clock, cannot go backward, as nanoseconds.
<br>
<br>    perf_counter(...)
<br>        perf_counter() -> float
<br>
<br>        Performance counter for benchmarking.
<br>
<br>    perf_counter_ns(...)
<br>        perf_counter_ns() -> int
<br>
<br>        Performance counter for benchmarking as nanoseconds.
<br>
<br>    process_time(...)
<br>        process_time() -> float
<br>
<br>        Process time for profiling: sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
<br>
<br>    process_time_ns(...)
<br>        process_time() -> int
<br>
<br>        Process time for profiling as nanoseconds:
<br>        sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
<br>
<br>    sleep(...)
<br>        sleep(seconds)
<br>
<br>        Delay execution for a given number of seconds.  The argument may be
<br>        a floating point number for subsecond precision.
<br>
<br>    strftime(...)
<br>        strftime(format[, tuple]) -> string
<br>
<br>        Convert a time tuple to a string according to a format specification.
<br>        See the library reference manual for formatting codes. When the time tuple
<br>        is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
<br>
<br>        Commonly used format codes:
<br>
<br>        %Y  Year with century as a decimal number.
<br>        %m  Month as a decimal number [01,12].
<br>        %d  Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].

<br>        %I  Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
<br>        %p  Locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
<br>
<br>        Other codes may be available on your platform.  See documentation for
<br>        the C library strftime function.
<br>
<br>    strptime(...)
<br>        strptime(string, format) -> struct_time
<br>
<br>        Parse a string to a time tuple according to a format specification.
<br>        See the library reference manual for formatting codes (same as
<br>        strftime()).
<br>
<br>        Commonly used format codes:
<br>
<br>        %Y  Year with century as a decimal number.

<br>        %I  Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
<br>        %p  Locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
<br>
<br>        Other codes may be available on your platform.  See documentation for
<br>        the C library strftime function.
<br>

<br>     |  Methods defined here:
<br>     |
<br>     |  __init__(self, tqdm_cls, sleep_interval)
<br>     |      This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. Arguments are:
<br>     |
<br>     |      *group* should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup
<br>     |      class is implemented.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *target* is the callable object to be invoked by the run()
<br>     |      method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of
<br>     |      the form "Thread-N" where N is a small decimal number.
<br>     |
<br>     |      *args* is the argument tuple for the target invocation. Defaults to ().
<br>     |
<br>     |      *kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target
<br>     |      invocation. Defaults to {}.
<br>     |
<br>     |      If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke
<br>     |      the base class constructor (Thread.__init__()) before doing anything
<br>     |      else to the thread.

<br>     |
<br>     |      You may override this method in a subclass. The standard run() method
<br>     |      invokes the callable object passed to the object's constructor as the

<br>     |      Return whether the thread is alive.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just
<br>     |      after the run() method terminates. The module function enumerate()
<br>     |      returns a list of all alive threads.

<br>     |  is_alive(self)
<br>     |      Return whether the thread is alive.

<br>     |      This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just
<br>     |      after the run() method terminates. The module function enumerate()
<br>     |      returns a list of all alive threads.
<br>     |
<br>     |  join(self, timeout=None)
<br>     |      Wait until the thread terminates.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is
<br>     |      called terminates -- either normally or through an unhandled exception
<br>     |      or until the optional timeout occurs.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
<br>     |      floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
<br>     |      (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call
<br>     |      isAlive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the
<br>     |      thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.
<br>     |
<br>     |      When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
<br>     |      block until the thread terminates.
<br>     |
<br>     |      A thread can be join()ed many times.
<br>     |
<br>     |      join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current
<br>     |      thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a
<br>     |      thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same
<br>     |      exception.

<br>     |
<br>     |      It must be called at most once per thread object. It arranges for the
<br>     |      object's run() method to be invoked in a separate thread of control.
<br>     |
<br>     |      This method will raise a RuntimeError if called more than once on the
<br>     |      same thread object.

<br>     |
<br>     |      This must be set before start() is called, otherwise RuntimeError is
<br>     |      raised. Its initial value is inherited from the creating thread; the

<br>     |      A string used for identification purposes only.
<br>     |
<br>     |      It has no semantics. Multiple threads may be given the same name. The

<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      iterable  : iterable, optional
<br>     |          Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.
<br>     |          Leave blank to manually manage the updates.
<br>     |      desc  : str, optional
<br>     |          Prefix for the progressbar.
<br>     |      total  : int, optional
<br>     |          The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,
<br>     |          len(iterable) is used if possible. If float("inf") or as a last
<br>     |          resort, only basic progress statistics are displayed
<br>     |          (no ETA, no progressbar).
<br>     |          If `gui` is True and this parameter needs subsequent updating,
<br>     |          specify an initial arbitrary large positive integer,
<br>     |          e.g. int(9e9).
<br>     |      leave  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If [default: True], keeps all traces of the progressbar
<br>     |          upon termination of iteration.
<br>     |      file  : `io.TextIOWrapper` or `io.StringIO`, optional
<br>     |          Specifies where to output the progress messages
<br>     |          (default: sys.stderr). Uses `file.write(str)` and `file.flush()`
<br>     |          methods.
<br>     |      ncols  : int, optional
<br>     |          The width of the entire output message. If specified,
<br>     |          dynamically resizes the progressbar to stay within this bound.
<br>     |          If unspecified, attempts to use environment width. The
<br>     |          fallback is a meter width of 10 and no limit for the counter and
<br>     |          statistics. If 0, will not print any meter (only stats).
<br>     |      mininterval  : float, optional
<br>     |          Minimum progress display update interval [default: 0.1] seconds.
<br>     |      maxinterval  : float, optional
<br>     |          Maximum progress display update interval [default: 10] seconds.
<br>     |          Automatically adjusts `miniters` to correspond to `mininterval`
<br>     |          after long display update lag. Only works if `dynamic_miniters`
<br>     |          or monitor thread is enabled.
<br>     |      miniters  : int, optional
<br>     |          Minimum progress display update interval, in iterations.
<br>     |          If 0 and `dynamic_miniters`, will automatically adjust to equal
<br>     |          `mininterval` (more CPU efficient, good for tight loops).
<br>     |          If > 0, will skip display of specified number of iterations.
<br>     |          Tweak this and `mininterval` to get very efficient loops.
<br>     |          If your progress is erratic with both fast and slow iterations
<br>     |          (network, skipping items, etc) you should set miniters=1.
<br>     |      ascii  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If unspecified or False, use unicode (smooth blocks) to fill
<br>     |          the meter. The fallback is to use ASCII characters `1-9 #`.
<br>     |      disable  : bool, optional
<br>     |          Whether to disable the entire progressbar wrapper
<br>     |          [default: False]. If set to None, disable on non-TTY.
<br>     |      unit  : str, optional
<br>     |          String that will be used to define the unit of each iteration
<br>     |          [default: it].
<br>     |      unit_scale  : bool or int or float, optional
<br>     |          If 1 or True, the number of iterations will be reduced/scaled
<br>     |          automatically and a metric prefix following the
<br>     |          International System of Units standard will be added
<br>     |          (kilo, mega, etc.) [default: False]. If any other non-zero
<br>     |          number, will scale `total` and `n`.
<br>     |      dynamic_ncols  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If set, constantly alters `ncols` to the environment (allowing
<br>     |          for window resizes) [default: False].
<br>     |      smoothing  : float, optional
<br>     |          Exponential moving average smoothing factor for speed estimates
<br>     |          (ignored in GUI mode). Ranges from 0 (average speed) to 1
<br>     |          (current/instantaneous speed) [default: 0.3].
<br>     |      bar_format  : str, optional
<br>     |          Specify a custom bar string formatting. May impact performance.
<br>     |          [default: '{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}'], where
<br>     |          l_bar='{desc}: {percentage:3.0f}%|' and
<br>     |          r_bar='| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, '
<br>     |            '{rate_fmt}{postfix}]'
<br>     |          Possible vars: l_bar, bar, r_bar, n, n_fmt, total, total_fmt,
<br>     |            percentage, rate, rate_fmt, rate_noinv, rate_noinv_fmt,
<br>     |            rate_inv, rate_inv_fmt, elapsed, remaining, desc, postfix.
<br>     |          Note that a trailing ": " is automatically removed after {desc}
<br>     |          if the latter is empty.
<br>     |      initial  : int, optional
<br>     |          The initial counter value. Useful when restarting a progress
<br>     |          bar [default: 0].
<br>     |      position  : int, optional
<br>     |          Specify the line offset to print this bar (starting from 0)
<br>     |          Automatic if unspecified.
<br>     |          Useful to manage multiple bars at once (eg, from threads).
<br>     |      postfix  : dict or *, optional
<br>     |          Specify additional stats to display at the end of the bar.
<br>     |          Calls `set_postfix(**postfix)` if possible (dict).
<br>     |      unit_divisor  : float, optional
<br>     |          [default: 1000], ignored unless `unit_scale` is True.
<br>     |      gui  : bool, optional
<br>     |          WARNING: internal parameter - do not use.
<br>     |          Use tqdm_gui(...) instead. If set, will attempt to use
<br>     |          matplotlib animations for a graphical output [default: False].

<br>     |      ...    t.update(len(current_buffer))
<br>     |      >>> t.close()
<br>     |      The last line is highly recommended, but possibly not necessary if

<br>     |      Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
<br>     |
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      n  : int
<br>     |          Number of finished iterations.
<br>     |      total  : int
<br>     |          The expected total number of iterations. If meaningless (), only
<br>     |          basic progress statistics are displayed (no ETA).
<br>     |      elapsed  : float
<br>     |          Number of seconds passed since start.
<br>     |      ncols  : int, optional
<br>     |          The width of the entire output message. If specified,
<br>     |          dynamically resizes the progress meter to stay within this bound
<br>     |          [default: None]. The fallback meter width is 10 for the progress
<br>     |          bar + no limit for the iterations counter and statistics. If 0,
<br>     |          will not print any meter (only stats).
<br>     |      prefix  : str, optional
<br>     |          Prefix message (included in total width) [default: ''].
<br>     |          Use as {desc} in bar_format string.
<br>     |      ascii  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If not set, use unicode (smooth blocks) to fill the meter
<br>     |          [default: False]. The fallback is to use ASCII characters
<br>     |          (1-9 #).
<br>     |      unit  : str, optional
<br>     |          The iteration unit [default: 'it'].
<br>     |      unit_scale  : bool or int or float, optional
<br>     |          If 1 or True, the number of iterations will be printed with an
<br>     |          appropriate SI metric prefix (k = 10^3, M = 10^6, etc.)
<br>     |          [default: False]. If any other non-zero number, will scale
<br>     |          `total` and `n`.
<br>     |      rate  : float, optional
<br>     |          Manual override for iteration rate.
<br>     |          If [default: None], uses n/elapsed.
<br>     |      bar_format  : str, optional
<br>     |          Specify a custom bar string formatting. May impact performance.
<br>     |          [default: '{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}'], where
<br>     |          l_bar='{desc}: {percentage:3.0f}%|' and
<br>     |          r_bar='| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, '
<br>     |            '{rate_fmt}{postfix}]'
<br>     |          Possible vars: l_bar, bar, r_bar, n, n_fmt, total, total_fmt,
<br>     |            percentage, rate, rate_fmt, rate_noinv, rate_noinv_fmt,
<br>     |            rate_inv, rate_inv_fmt, elapsed, remaining, desc, postfix.
<br>     |          Note that a trailing ": " is automatically removed after {desc}
<br>     |          if the latter is empty.
<br>     |      postfix  : *, optional
<br>     |          Similar to `prefix`, but placed at the end
<br>     |          (e.g. for additional stats).
<br>     |          Note: postfix is usually a string (not a dict) for this method,
<br>     |          and will if possible be set to postfix = ', ' + postfix.
<br>     |          However other types are supported (#382).
<br>     |      unit_divisor  : float, optional
<br>     |          [default: 1000], ignored unless `unit_scale` is True.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Returns

<br>     |
<br>     |  __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      iterable  : iterable, optional
<br>     |          Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.
<br>     |          Leave blank to manually manage the updates.
<br>     |      desc  : str, optional
<br>     |          Prefix for the progressbar.
<br>     |      total  : int, optional
<br>     |          The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,
<br>     |          len(iterable) is used if possible. If float("inf") or as a last
<br>     |          resort, only basic progress statistics are displayed
<br>     |          (no ETA, no progressbar).
<br>     |          If `gui` is True and this parameter needs subsequent updating,
<br>     |          specify an initial arbitrary large positive integer,
<br>     |          e.g. int(9e9).
<br>     |      leave  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If [default: True], keeps all traces of the progressbar
<br>     |          upon termination of iteration.
<br>     |      file  : `io.TextIOWrapper` or `io.StringIO`, optional
<br>     |          Specifies where to output the progress messages
<br>     |          (default: sys.stderr). Uses `file.write(str)` and `file.flush()`
<br>     |          methods.
<br>     |      ncols  : int, optional
<br>     |          The width of the entire output message. If specified,
<br>     |          dynamically resizes the progressbar to stay within this bound.
<br>     |          If unspecified, attempts to use environment width. The
<br>     |          fallback is a meter width of 10 and no limit for the counter and
<br>     |          statistics. If 0, will not print any meter (only stats).
<br>     |      mininterval  : float, optional
<br>     |          Minimum progress display update interval [default: 0.1] seconds.
<br>     |      maxinterval  : float, optional
<br>     |          Maximum progress display update interval [default: 10] seconds.
<br>     |          Automatically adjusts `miniters` to correspond to `mininterval`
<br>     |          after long display update lag. Only works if `dynamic_miniters`
<br>     |          or monitor thread is enabled.
<br>     |      miniters  : int, optional
<br>     |          Minimum progress display update interval, in iterations.
<br>     |          If 0 and `dynamic_miniters`, will automatically adjust to equal
<br>     |          `mininterval` (more CPU efficient, good for tight loops).
<br>     |          If > 0, will skip display of specified number of iterations.
<br>     |          Tweak this and `mininterval` to get very efficient loops.
<br>     |          If your progress is erratic with both fast and slow iterations
<br>     |          (network, skipping items, etc) you should set miniters=1.
<br>     |      ascii  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If unspecified or False, use unicode (smooth blocks) to fill
<br>     |          the meter. The fallback is to use ASCII characters `1-9 #`.
<br>     |      disable  : bool, optional
<br>     |          Whether to disable the entire progressbar wrapper
<br>     |          [default: False]. If set to None, disable on non-TTY.
<br>     |      unit  : str, optional
<br>     |          String that will be used to define the unit of each iteration
<br>     |          [default: it].
<br>     |      unit_scale  : bool or int or float, optional
<br>     |          If 1 or True, the number of iterations will be reduced/scaled
<br>     |          automatically and a metric prefix following the
<br>     |          International System of Units standard will be added
<br>     |          (kilo, mega, etc.) [default: False]. If any other non-zero
<br>     |          number, will scale `total` and `n`.
<br>     |      dynamic_ncols  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If set, constantly alters `ncols` to the environment (allowing
<br>     |          for window resizes) [default: False].
<br>     |      smoothing  : float, optional
<br>     |          Exponential moving average smoothing factor for speed estimates
<br>     |          (ignored in GUI mode). Ranges from 0 (average speed) to 1
<br>     |          (current/instantaneous speed) [default: 0.3].
<br>     |      bar_format  : str, optional
<br>     |          Specify a custom bar string formatting. May impact performance.
<br>     |          [default: '{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}'], where
<br>     |          l_bar='{desc}: {percentage:3.0f}%|' and
<br>     |          r_bar='| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, '
<br>     |            '{rate_fmt}{postfix}]'
<br>     |          Possible vars: l_bar, bar, r_bar, n, n_fmt, total, total_fmt,
<br>     |            percentage, rate, rate_fmt, rate_noinv, rate_noinv_fmt,
<br>     |            rate_inv, rate_inv_fmt, elapsed, remaining, desc, postfix.
<br>     |          Note that a trailing ": " is automatically removed after {desc}
<br>     |          if the latter is empty.
<br>     |      initial  : int, optional
<br>     |          The initial counter value. Useful when restarting a progress
<br>     |          bar [default: 0].
<br>     |      position  : int, optional
<br>     |          Specify the line offset to print this bar (starting from 0)
<br>     |          Automatic if unspecified.
<br>     |          Useful to manage multiple bars at once (eg, from threads).
<br>     |      postfix  : dict or *, optional
<br>     |          Specify additional stats to display at the end of the bar.
<br>     |          Calls `set_postfix(**postfix)` if possible (dict).
<br>     |      unit_divisor  : float, optional
<br>     |          [default: 1000], ignored unless `unit_scale` is True.
<br>     |      gui  : bool, optional
<br>     |          WARNING: internal parameter - do not use.
<br>     |          Use tqdm_gui(...) instead. If set, will attempt to use
<br>     |          matplotlib animations for a graphical output [default: False].
<br>     |
<br>     |      Returns
<br>     |      -------
<br>     |      out  : decorated iterator.
<br>     |
<br>     |  __iter__(self)
<br>     |      Backward-compatibility to use: for x in tqdm(iterable)
<br>     |
<br>     |  close(self)
<br>     |      Cleanup and (if leave=False) close the progressbar.
<br>     |
<br>     |  update(self, n=1)
<br>     |      Manually update the progress bar, useful for streams
<br>     |      such as reading files.
<br>     |      E.g.:
<br>     |      >>> t = tqdm(total=filesize) # Initialise
<br>     |      >>> for current_buffer in stream:
<br>     |      ...    ...
<br>     |      ...    t.update(len(current_buffer))
<br>     |      >>> t.close()
<br>     |      The last line is highly recommended, but possibly not necessary if
<br>     |      `t.update()` will be called in such a way that `filesize` will be
<br>     |      exactly reached and printed.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      n  : int, optional

<br>     |
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      x  : float
<br>     |          New value to include in EMA.
<br>     |      mu  : float, optional

<br>     |      Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
<br>     |
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      n  : int
<br>     |          Number of finished iterations.
<br>     |      total  : int
<br>     |          The expected total number of iterations. If meaningless (), only
<br>     |          basic progress statistics are displayed (no ETA).
<br>     |      elapsed  : float
<br>     |          Number of seconds passed since start.
<br>     |      ncols  : int, optional
<br>     |          The width of the entire output message. If specified,
<br>     |          dynamically resizes the progress meter to stay within this bound
<br>     |          [default: None]. The fallback meter width is 10 for the progress
<br>     |          bar + no limit for the iterations counter and statistics. If 0,
<br>     |          will not print any meter (only stats).
<br>     |      prefix  : str, optional
<br>     |          Prefix message (included in total width) [default: ''].
<br>     |          Use as {desc} in bar_format string.
<br>     |      ascii  : bool, optional
<br>     |          If not set, use unicode (smooth blocks) to fill the meter
<br>     |          [default: False]. The fallback is to use ASCII characters
<br>     |          (1-9 #).
<br>     |      unit  : str, optional
<br>     |          The iteration unit [default: 'it'].
<br>     |      unit_scale  : bool or int or float, optional
<br>     |          If 1 or True, the number of iterations will be printed with an
<br>     |          appropriate SI metric prefix (k = 10^3, M = 10^6, etc.)
<br>     |          [default: False]. If any other non-zero number, will scale
<br>     |          `total` and `n`.
<br>     |      rate  : float, optional
<br>     |          Manual override for iteration rate.
<br>     |          If [default: None], uses n/elapsed.
<br>     |      bar_format  : str, optional
<br>     |          Specify a custom bar string formatting. May impact performance.
<br>     |          [default: '{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}'], where
<br>     |          l_bar='{desc}: {percentage:3.0f}%|' and
<br>     |          r_bar='| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, '
<br>     |            '{rate_fmt}{postfix}]'
<br>     |          Possible vars: l_bar, bar, r_bar, n, n_fmt, total, total_fmt,
<br>     |            percentage, rate, rate_fmt, rate_noinv, rate_noinv_fmt,
<br>     |            rate_inv, rate_inv_fmt, elapsed, remaining, desc, postfix.
<br>     |          Note that a trailing ": " is automatically removed after {desc}
<br>     |          if the latter is empty.
<br>     |      postfix  : *, optional
<br>     |          Similar to `prefix`, but placed at the end
<br>     |          (e.g. for additional stats).
<br>     |          Note: postfix is usually a string (not a dict) for this method,
<br>     |          and will if possible be set to postfix = ', ' + postfix.
<br>     |          However other types are supported (#382).
<br>     |      unit_divisor  : float, optional
<br>     |          [default: 1000], ignored unless `unit_scale` is True.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Returns
<br>     |      -------
<br>     |      out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
<br>     |

<br>     |      -------
<br>     |      out  : str
<br>     |          Formatted number.
<br>     |
<br>     |  format_sizeof(num, suffix='', divisor=1000)
<br>     |      Formats a number (greater than unity) with SI Order of Magnitude
<br>     |      prefixes.
<br>     |
<br>     |      Parameters
<br>     |      ----------
<br>     |      num  : float
<br>     |          Number ( >= 1) to format.
<br>     |      suffix  : str, optional
<br>     |          Post-postfix [default: ''].
<br>     |      divisor  : float, optionl
<br>     |          Divisor between prefixes [default: 1000].
<br>     |

<br>     |      -------
<br>     |      out  : str
<br>     |          Number with Order of Magnitude SI unit postfix.
<br>     |
<br>     |  status_printer(file)
<br>     |      Manage the printing and in-place updating of a line of characters.
<br>     |      Note that if the string is longer than a line, then in-place
<br>     |      updating may not work (it will print a new line at each refresh).

<br>
<br>Run "pydoc -p <port>" to start an HTTP server on the given port on the
<br>local machine.  Port number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.
<br>
<br>Run "pydoc -b" to start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and
<br>open a Web browser to interactively browse documentation.  Combine with

<br>        result directly so it can be formatted for display in an html page.

<br>
<br>    Start an HTML/text server thread, so HTML or text documents can be
<br>    browsed dynamically and interactively with a Web browser.  Example use:
<br>
<br>        >>> import time
<br>        >>> import pydoc
<br>
<br>        Define a URL handler.  To determine what the client is asking
<br>        for, check the URL and content_type.
<br>
<br>        Then get or generate some text or HTML code and return it.
<br>
<br>        >>> def my_url_handler(url, content_type):
<br>        ...     text = 'the URL sent was: (%s, %s)' % (url, content_type)
<br>        ...     return text
<br>
<br>        Start server thread on port 0.
<br>        If you use port 0, the server will pick a random port number.
<br>        You can then use serverthread.port to get the port number.
<br>
<br>        >>> port = 0
<br>        >>> serverthread = pydoc._start_server(my_url_handler, port)
<br>
<br>        Check that the server is really started.  If it is, open browser
<br>        and get first page.  Use serverthread.url as the starting page.
<br>
<br>        >>> if serverthread.serving:
<br>        ...    import webbrowser
<br>
<br>        The next two lines are commented out so a browser doesn't open if
<br>        doctest is run on this module.
<br>
<br>        #...    webbrowser.open(serverthread.url)
<br>        #True
<br>
<br>        Let the server do its thing. We just need to monitor its status.
<br>        Use time.sleep so the loop doesn't hog the CPU.
<br>
<br>        >>> starttime = time.time()
<br>        >>> timeout = 1                    #seconds
<br>
<br>        This is a short timeout for testing purposes.
<br>
<br>        >>> while serverthread.serving:
<br>        ...     time.sleep(.01)
<br>        ...     if serverthread.serving and time.time() - starttime > timeout:
<br>        ...          serverthread.stop()
<br>        ...          break
<br>
<br>        Print any errors that may have occurred.
<br>
<br>        >>> print(serverthread.error)
<br>        None
